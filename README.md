## Installation: 
The codes .py and .ipynb files in this repository run on any Anaconda installed Python 3.0. The .m files run on any device with Matlab installed

## Project Motivation:
The motivation behind the different projects in this project vary. But in general, they were all undertaken to put into practice
my software development skills applying object oriented programming, and building statistical softwares.

## File Descriptions:
This repository include the  Jupiter Noteboks 'IdokoCM_DataSc_Project1.ipynb ' which contains the break-down of my work and 'drop_down.ipynb ' which is a function that can be used to get an equivalent drop down of responses in a target_column that match the results of splitting multiple responses in a given pseudo_column. Other files in the repository are image/figure results from the analysis. 

## Results:
