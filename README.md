## Installation: 
The codes .py and .ipynb files in this repository run on any Anaconda installed Python 3.0. The .m files run on any device with Matlab installed

## Project Motivation:
The motivation behind the different projects in this project vary. But in general, they were all undertaken to put into practice
my software development skills applying object oriented programming, and building statistical softwares.

## File Descriptions:
The number of files in this repo will keep changing as I add new projects. The BoardGame is symply a tit_tac_toe game. The EnvelopeScript.m is a matlab file for adding a standard deviation envelope to a bunch of plots from a monte-carlo simulation. The prob_of_success.py file is used to model the Binomial distribution. The Hackaton.py file applies LSTM neural network in predicting the volume of production from a differnt wells in a gas field. Each of the files in this repo. is a susbsidiary of a bigger project I have/am undertaken/undertaking.
